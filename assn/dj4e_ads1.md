Building a Classified Ad Web Site
=================================

In this assignment, you will build a web site that is roughly equivalent to

https://chucklist.dj4e.com/m1

This web site is a classified ad web site.   People can view ads without logging in
and if they log in, they can create their own ads.   It uses a social login
that allows logging in using github accounts.

You will build this application by borrowing parts and pieces from the code that runs

https://samples.dj4e.com/

and combining them into a single application.

Make sure to get the latest version of dj4e-samples.  If you have never checked it out
on PythonAnywhere:

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples

If you have already checked `dj4e-samples`  on PythonAnywhere do:

    workon django4     # or django3 if needed
    cd ~/dj4e-samples
    git pull
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py check

To switch to using the MySQL database outside of the PythonAnywhere, you might need to install
the MySQL client and possibly the server on your system before `pip install` will work using
instructions at https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/ - once you have the MySQL
prerequisites installed or are using PythonAnywhere, you can run:

    pip install mysqlclient==1.4.6

So your Python code can connect to MySQL databases.  If you are having installation problems,
you can keep using the SQLite database but it will mean that your application will start to
run much more slowly as we add complexity to the application.  It is especially to switch to
MySQL on PythonAnywhere.


__Important Note:__ If you find you have a problem saving files in the PythonAnywhere
system using their browser-based editor, you might need to turn off your ad blocker for
this site - weird but true.

Pulling In Code From Samples
----------------------------

In this section, we will break and then fix your `settings.py` and `urls.py`.
When this is done, the autos, cats, dogs, etc will stop working unless you
add them back to these two files.  It is OK for these applications not to be working.
The autograder will just look at /ads.

(1) Copy the `settings.py` and `urls.py` files and the entire
`home` folder from the `dj4e-samples` project:

    cp ~/dj4e-samples/dj4e-samples/settings.py ~/django_projects/mysite/mysite
    cp ~/dj4e-samples/dj4e-samples/urls.py ~/django_projects/mysite/mysite
    cp -r ~/dj4e-samples/home/* ~/django_projects/mysite/home

(2) Edit `~/django_projects/mysite/mysite/settings.py` and then delete
all the `INSTALLED_APPLICATIONS` after `home`.  You will have to search
and replace `dj4e-samples` with `mysite` in a few places.  Also set
the name of your application in the `settings.py` file to something other
than `ChucksList`:

    # Used for a default title
    APP_NAME = 'ChucksList'

This shows up in default page titles and default page navigation.

(3) Edit your `django_projects/mysite/mysite/urls.py` and
remove all of the `path()` calls to the sample applications. Make
sure to keep the `path()` to `home.urls`.  Also keep
the `site` and `favicon` rules in your `urls.py`.

(4) Edit the file `django_projects/mysite/home/templates/home/main.html` and replace the
contents with this:

    {% extends "base_bootstrap.html" %}
    {% block content %}
        <h1>Welcome to {{ settings.APP_NAME }}</h1>
        <p>
        Hello world.
        </p>
    {% endblock content %}

(5) At this point, you should be able to run:

    python3 manage.py check

Keep running `check` until it does not find any errors.

If you get an error like `Could not import github_settings.py for social_django`
when running `manage.py` or restarting your PythonAnywhere webapp,
don't worry - you will see this warning until you set up the social login.

<b>If you are using Ngrok skip to step 9, otherwise continue with these steps.</b>

(6) We are going to switch your application on PythonAnywhere from using an
SQLite database to a MySQL database for the rest of this course.  If you keep running
SQLite and your application stores too much data it will start to slow down.
If you are running locally, you can keep using SQLite.

(7) To use MySQL, first go to the `Databases` tab in PythonAnywhere. Make a MySQL database
named `ads` and choose a name and password and write them down.

(8) Edit `~/django_projects/mysite/mysite/settings.py` and find the existing
value for the `DATABASES` variable and comment it out.

    # DATABASES = {
    #     'default': {
    #         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
    #         'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    #     }
    # }

Add an entry to point Django at your newly created MySQL database.  In this example,
your PythonAnywhere account is `drchuck` and the database you created is `ads` and
the password you set for the database is `phone_8675309`.   Change the sample values below
to the values for your database.

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
            'NAME': 'drchuck$ads',
            'USER': 'drchuck',
            'PASSWORD': 'phone_8675309',
            'HOST': 'drchuck.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com',
             'OPTIONS': {
                'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'",
            },
        }
    }

(9) Once `check` works you will need to run your migrations and make a new
administrator account:

    cd ~/django_projects/mysite
    python manage.py makemigrations      # Might say "no changes"
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser

If the `makemigrations` works and `migrate` fails, you may have an error
in the `DATABASE` section of your `settings.py`.   You can edit your `settings.py`
and rerun the `migrate` until it works.

Somtimes `migrations` or `makemigrations` takes up to a few minutes - if they are running
and not showning any errors - please be patient.  If the migrations process is
interrupted - you might need to drop your MySQL tables and run the migrations again - instructions
are shown below to drop the databases tables so you can run the migrations
on a fresh database.

(10) If you restart your web application, there won't be many working urls.
Try these two to see if you have the home code working properly:

    https://your-account.pythonanywhere.com/
    https://your-account.pythonanywhere.com/favicon.ico
    https://your-account.pythonanywhere.com/accounts/login

Look at how pretty the login form looks :).
Don't worry about the social login yet. We will get to that later.
Favicons are shown in the browser tabs.  We will get to favicons later too :)

Building the Ads Application
----------------------------

In this section, you will pull bits and pieces of the sample applications repository and pull them
into your `ads` application.

__Important Note:__ If you find you have a problem saving files in the PythonAnywhere
system using their browser-based editor, you might need to turn off your ad blocker for
this site - weird but true.

(1) Create a new `ads` application within your `mysite` project:

    cd django_projects/mysite
    python3 manage.py startapp ads

Then add the application to your `mysite/mysite/settings.py` and `mysite/mysite/urls.py`.

(2) Use this in your `ads/model.py`:

    from django.db import models
    from django.core.validators import MinLengthValidator
    from django.conf import settings

    class Ad(models.Model) :
        title = models.CharField(
                max_length=200,
                validators=[MinLengthValidator(2, "Title must be greater than 2 characters")]
        )
        price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=7, decimal_places=2, null=True)
        text = models.TextField()
        owner = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

        # Shows up in the admin list
        def __str__(self):
            return self.title

(3) Copy the `owner.py` from `myarts` to your ads application.  This is the one file you <b>do not</b>
have to change at all (thanks to object orientation ðŸ˜Š).

(4) The files `admin.py`, `views.py`, `urls.py`, and the `templates` in the `myarts` folder will require significant
adaptation to be suitable for a classified
ad application and the above model.   A big part of this assignment is to use the
view classes that are in `owner.py` and used in `views.py`.  The new `owner` field should
not be shown to the user on the create and update forms, it should be automatically set
by the classes like `OwnerCreateView` in `owner.py`.  If you see an "owner" drop down
in your create screen the program is not implemented correctly and will fail the autograder.

(5) Adapt the templates in `myarts/templates/myarts` as a starting point to create the needed
templates in `ads/templates/ads`.

(6) When you are implementing the update and delete views, make sure to follow the url patterns
for the update and delete operations.  They should be of the form `/ad/14/update`
and `/ad/14/delete`.  Something like the following should work in your `urls.py`:

    from django.urls import path, reverse_lazy
    from . import views

    app_name='ads'
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.AdListView.as_view(), name='all'),
        path('ad/<int:pk>', views.AdDetailView.as_view(), name='ad_detail'),
        path('ad/create',
            views.AdCreateView.as_view(success_url=reverse_lazy('ads:all')), name='ad_create'),
        path('ad/<int:pk>/update',
            views.AdUpdateView.as_view(success_url=reverse_lazy('ads:all')), name='ad_update'),
        path('ad/<int:pk>/delete',
            views.AdDeleteView.as_view(success_url=reverse_lazy('ads:all')), name='ad_delete'),
    ]

(7) As you build the application, use `check` periodically as you complete some of the code.

    python3 manage.py check

(8) Once your application is mostly complete and can pass the `check`
without error, add the new models to your migrations and database tables:

    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate

Debugging: Searching through all your files in the bash shell
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you have errors, you might find the `grep` tool very helpful in figuring out where you might find your errors.
For example, lets say after you did all the editing, and went to the ads url and got this error:

    NoReverseMatch at /ads
    'myarts' is not a registered namespace

You *thought* you fixed all the instances where the string "myarts" was in your code, but you must have missed one.
You can manually look at every file individually or use the following command to let the computer do the searching:

    cd ~/django_projects/mysite
    grep -ri myarts *

You might see output like this:

    ads/templates/ads/ad_list.html:<a href="{% url 'login' %}?next={% url 'myarts:all' %}">Login</a>

The `grep` program searches files in the current  folder and subfolders for any lines
in any file that have the string "myarts" in them and shows you the file name and the line it is mentioned.

The `grep` command is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep" target="_blank">"Generalized Regular
Expression Parser"</a> and is one of the most useful Linux commands to know.
The 'r' means 'recursive' and the 'i' means 'ignore case.   The `grep` program will save you so much time ðŸ˜Š.

Adding the Bootstrap menu to the top of the page
------------------------------------------------

Next we will add the bootstrap navigation bar to the top of your application as shown in:

https://chucklist.dj4e.com/

This top bar includes a 'Create Ad' navigation item and the login/logout navigation with
gravatar when the user logs in.

(1) Edit all four of the `ads_` files in `ads/templates/ads` to change them so
they extend `ads/base_menu.html`.  Change the first line of each file from:

    {% extends "base_bootstrap.html" %}

to be:

    {% extends "base_menu.html" %}

(2) Then create `home/templates/base_menu.html` with the following content:

    {% extends "base_bootstrap.html" %}
    {% block navbar %}
    {% load app_tags %}
    <nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-inverse">
      <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="navbar-header">
            <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">{{ settings.APP_NAME }}</a>
        </div>
        <!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22047251/django-dynamically-get-view-url-and-check-if-its-the-current-page -->
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
          {% url 'ads' as ads %}
          <li {% if request.get_full_path == ads %}class="active"{% endif %}>
              <a href="{% url 'ads:all' %}">Ads</a></li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
            {% if user.is_authenticated %}
            <li>
            <a href="{% url 'ads:ad_create' %}">Create Ad</a>
            </li>
            <li class="dropdown">
                <a href="#" data-toggle="dropdown" class="dropdown-toggle">
                    <img style="width: 25px;" src="{{ user|gravatar:60 }}"/><b class="caret"></b>
                </a>
                <ul class="dropdown-menu">
                    <li><a href="{% url 'logout' %}?next={% url 'ads:all' %}">Logout</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            {% else %}
            <li>
            <a href="{% url 'login' %}?next={% url 'ads:all' %}">Login</a>
            </li>
            {% endif %}
        </ul>
      </div>
    </nav>
    {% endblock %}

(3) Find the line in your `base_bootstrap.html` that looks like this:

        <meta name="dj4e-code" content="99999999">

   and change the `9999999`  to be "<span id="dj4e-code">missing</span>"

Make sure to check the autograder for additional markup requirements.

When you are done, you should see an 'Ads' menu on the left and a 'Create Ad' link on the right just like the
sample implementation.

Manual Testing
--------------

It is always a good idea to manually test your application before submitting it for grading.  Here
are a set of manual test steps:

* Make two accounts if you have not already done so
* Log in to your application on the first account
* Make sure the menu bar shows at the top of all of the screens - the autograder gets grumpy about a missing menu on a page
* Create an ad
* Try to submit an add with no title - make sure that it complains
* Create an ad
* In the all ads list make sure that the edit / delete button shows correctly
* View its details - make sure the edit / delete button shows up correctly
* Update the ad, check that the details are correct after the update
* Delete the ad - just to make sure it works
* Create two more ads
* Log in on the second account - make sure you **do not** see edit / delete buttons on the existing ads
* Go into one the detail for the ad created by the other user -  make sure you **do not** see edit / delete buttons
* Create a new ad on the second account
* Make sure that in the "all ads list" the edit / delete buttons are only present on the ads the second user "owns"
* Delete the ad


Fun Challenges
--------------

(1) Make yourself a gravatar at https://en.gravatar.com/ - it is super easy and you will see your
avatar when you log in in your application and elsewhere with gravatar enabled apps. The gravatar can be
anything you like - it does not have to be a picture of you.  The gravatar is associated an email address
so make sure to give an email address to the user you create with `createsuperuser`.

(2) Change your `home/static/favicon.ico` to a favicon of your own making.   I made my favicon
at https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/ - it might not change instantly after you update the favicon
because they are cached extensively.   Probably the best way to test is to go right to the favicon url
after you update the file and press 'Refresh' and/or switch browsers.  Sometimes the browswer caching
is "too effective" on a favicon so to force a real reload (command/ctrl + shift + r) to check if the new
favicon is really being served you can add a GET parameter to the URL to force it to be re-retrieved:

    https://chucklist.dj4e.com/favicon.ico?x=42

Change the `x` value to something else if you want to test over and over.

(3) To make the social login work.  Take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples/blob/main/dj4e-samples/github_settings-dist.py" target="_blank">
github_settings-dist.py</a>, copy it into
`mysite/mysite/github_settings.py` and go through the process on github to get your client ID and
secret.   The documentation is in comments of the file.  Also take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples/blob/main/dj4e-samples/urls.py" target="_blank">
dj4e-samples/urls.py</a> and make sure that the "Switch to social login" code is correct
and at the end of your `mysite/mysite/github_settings.py`.

You can register two applications with github - one on localhost and one on PythonAnywhere.  If you are
using github login on localhost - make sure that you register `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` instead
of `http://localhost:8000/` and use that in your browser to test your site.  If you
use localhost, you probably will get the `The redirect_uri MUST match the registered callback
URL for this application.` error message when you use social login.

Working with Ambiguity
----------------------

This assignment is more vague than previous assignments - on purpose.  The goal is to get
closer to the development model of actual applications. You know what you want to build
and start with a mostly blank slate.  You look at sample code, reuse some code from stuff
you built earlier, do some online
searching and glue pieces of what you find together to make your application.  Of course as
you are gluing bits from various places together, they always break and you have to adjust things
so they fit in your application.

So this is kind of like the real world - when you have to build your own first application
for someone else.

It is not tricky on purpose.  We want you to succeed in this assignment.  But we do want you
to do less cutting-and-pasting and more writing Django applications.

Some Common Errors in This Assignment
-------------------------------------

Since you are in effect starting with a brand new `mysite/settings.py` and `mysite/urls.py`, you might
find a few problems when you are running `python manage.py check` - I will keep a list of the common
problems and their solutions here:

(1) If you see an error message "TypeError: 'module' object is not iterable" when you are
running `python manage.py check`, this maybe because you mistakenly
edited the `ROOT_URLCONF` value in `settings.py`  - your value should be:

    ROOT_URLCONF = 'mysite.urls'

More will be added as the problems are identified.

(2) If you have a problem running `migrate` or `makemigrations` in step 9 above, you might want
to start with a fresh MySQL database.  Since we are using a MYSQL server, we can't
just delete the SQLite file and start over - but it is not much more difficult.

First go into `Consoles` and start a `MySQL` console.  You should go into a shell and see a prompt
like this - type the command `SHOW DATABASES;` to find your database:

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.
    mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
    +--------------------+
    | Database           |
    +--------------------+
    | information_schema |
    | dj4e$chucklist     |
    | dj4e$default       |
    +--------------------+
    3 rows in set (4.05 sec)
    mysql>

Note - <b>never touch</b> the `information_schema` database - if you mess with this you break your entire MySQL
installation and may need to create a completely new PythonAnywhere account.   Leave `information_schema`
alone.

Pick the database you are using (in your `settings.py`) and issuer the `USE` command to select
the database and run the `SHOW TABLES;` command:

    mysql> use dj4e$chucklist;
    Database changed
    mysql> SHOW TABLES;
    +----------------------------+
    | Tables_in_dj4e$chucklist   |
    +----------------------------+
    | ads_ad                     |
    | django_admin_log           |
    | django_content_type        |
    | django_migrations          |
    | django_session             |
    | social_auth_association    |
    | social_auth_code           |
    | social_auth_nonce          |
    | social_auth_partial        |
    | social_auth_usersocialauth |
    +----------------------------+
    10 rows in set (0.00 sec)
    mysql>

Your list of tables might have more or less tables.  To reset things, just run the
command `DROP TABLE ads_ad;` once for every table in the list.  From time to time
run `SHOW TABLES;` to see where things are going.  You want to drop every table.

If you try to drop a table and it complains about a foreign key constraint - skip
dropping the table and keep dropping the rest of the tables.  When you get to the end
to a `SHOW TABLES;` again and start dropping the remaining tables until you have none.
This happens because when you have a one-many relationship and a foreign key
you need to drop the "many" table (i.e. autos) before you can drop the "one" table
(i.e. makes).

Once you have no more tables, go back to the bash shell and run the following commands:

    cd ~/django_projects/mysite
    rm */migrations/00*

Then go back to step 9 and pick up with the `makemigrations` step.  Since your database is
completely empty - you will need to re-add any `createuser` accounts and/or the accounts which
are needed for the autograder to work.
