Classified Ad Web Site - Milestone 4
====================================

If you want a more challenging version of this assignment

In this assignment, you will expand your classified ads web site to add search functionality
equivalent to:

https://chucklist.dj4e.com/m4

We will add a search capability to your previous milestone by borrowing more parts and 
pieces from the sample code that runs:

https://samples.dj4e.com/well/

Once you understand what the `well` code is doing, you only have to change a few files:

* Your `urls.py` does not have to change

* You only have to change your "all" view in `views.py`

* You only have to change the list/all template.

There should not be any other changes required.

Manual Testing
--------------

It is always a good idea to manually test your application before submitting it for grading.  Here
are a set of manual test steps:

* Log in to your application and create several ads
* Search for some text in the body of one or more of your ads
* Note the "?search=" in the location bar in your browser
* Clear the search and see all of the results

Challenge
---------

Make the search look for text in either the body or the title.
