Building a Marketplace Web Site - Initial Setup
===============================================

In this assignment, you will start a series of assignments to build a web site that is roughly equivalent to

https://market.dj4e.com/m5/

This web site is a classified ad web site like Facebook MarketPlace.   People can view ads without logging in
and if they log in, they can create their own ads. You can log into this site using 
an account: <b>facebook</b> and a password of <b>Marketnn!</b> where "nn" is the 
two-digit number of Dr. Chuck's race car or the numeric value for asterisk in the ASCII character set.

Initial Setup
-------------

We provide an initial github repository for you to checkout and install on PythonAnywhere
with most of the base code already built so you can add your application.  To install the application,
follow the instructions in the `READMD.md` at:
