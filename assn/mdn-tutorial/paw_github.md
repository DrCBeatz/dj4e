Storing your Django Projects in GitHub
======================================

This excercise shows how to store your assignments in a private repository in 
<a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, 
if you have an account that supports a private repository.  Please don't put your
assignments for this site into a public repository on GitHub.

Go to GitHub, create a new private repo called `django_projects` - do not create
a README, .gitignore, or add a license.  You can do those things later - but for now
we want to make a new fresh and *empty* repository.

Go to your 
<a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">PythonAnywhere</a> 
account and start a bash shell.

Create a file

    cd ~/django_projects
    nano .gitignore

Put these three lines into the file and save it.

    __pycache__
    *.swp
    *.sqlite3

Remember that to see all the files in a folder (including those that start with a '.')
you need to type `ls -la`.

Still in your PythnonAnywhere shell in the `~/django_projects` folder, run
the following commands:

    git init
    git config --global push.default simple
    git add *
    git add .gitignore
    git status
    git config --global user.email "youremail@umich.edu"
    git config --global user.name "Your X. Name"
    git config --global credential.helper cache   # Optional but convienent
    git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=604800'  # Optional but convienent
    git commit -m "first commit" 
    git remote add origin https://github.com/--your-github-acct--/django_projects.git
    git push -u origin master
    (enter id and password for git)

Go to 

    https://github.com/--your-github-account---/django_projects

Verify the data has been pushed to the repo and verify that it is private.

If you get tired of typing your github credentials over and over, you can tell
the bash shell to cache them for a week using the following commands:

Local and Remote Repositories Out of Sync
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes when you have a repo and are working on files, and start typing
things like `git commit -a` or `git push` you start getting very strange
errors start appearing that imply that you can't do what you are trying to
do.

Often this is because you are doing things in your repo two different
places (i.e. your laptop and PythonAnywhere) and one or the other copies is
out of sync with the copy that you have stored in GitHub.

When your remote repository is "ahead" of your local repository, you 
will see the following error when you do a `git pull`:

    $ git status
    On branch master

    	modified:   locallibrary/settings.py

    $ git pull
    error: cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes.
    error: please commit or stash them.

Solving this is pretty simple, the following sequence will work:

    git stash
    git pull
    git stash apply

This undoes your local changes (except for added files whch don't 
affect the pull) but "stashes" them. 
Then the pull will work and the `git stash apply` retrieves your "stashed" 
changes and re-applies them.  

Harder to Fix Problems
----------------------

If you end up in a situation where git is complaining about a "merge conflict"
you can Google around and find a solution.  But sometimes that is 
kind of obtuse and it is easier to grab a fresh copy of your repo 
and manually re-apply your changes.

If things are really messed up and `git` is complaining about a lock file,
or something else very mysterious, sometimes the quickest 
way to get going again is to take a step back
and then go forward again.  This process assumes that you have something in 
github to go back to.  

Here are the steps to restore your `django_projects` folder.  You may 
lose a few bits in this process but your git folder will work again.

First lets see what changes we have made because we will need to redo
the changes.

    cd ~/django_projects
    git status

Then rename your folder and check out a fresh copy of your repository:

    cd ~
    mv django_projects broken_version
    git clone https://github.com/drchuck/django_projects.git

Replacing `drchuck` with your github account.

Now you have a fresh new copy of your github repository.  Then go into
the saved copy and see which files you want to copy over into the newly
checked out copy of your repo:

    cd ~/broken_version
    git status

Then for each file you want to put back into your freshly checked out repo, do:

    cp locallibrary/locallibrary/settings.py ../django_projects/locallibrary/locallibrary/settings.py

You can also use the Linux `diff` command to see how files differ before making
the copy:

    diff locallibrary/locallibrary/settings.py ../django_projects/locallibrary/locallibrary/settings.py

Use tab completion to make sure that you are typing folders and files 
correctly.

If you are dealing with a merge conflict, you may still need to go into the
newly checked out folder and edit the files before committing.  The git
merge process puts little marks in the file to show where the conflicts
were found.  Just test your code before committing and uploading - any merge
lines in the file will be syntax errors in your application that you can
fix.

You can change the folder paths from this example depending on 
what repo you are working with and where in your folder structure 
you are working.
