Skeleton Web Site
=================

This is our PythonAnywhere variant of the next step of the Mozilla Developer Network
tutorial:

You can view a

*Note:* If you are submitting these assignments to the autograder, make sure you finish
grading of one assignment before starting on the next assignment.  The autograder deducts
points for hainv *too many* features implemented.

Go to your
<a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">PythonAnywhere</a>
account and start a bash shell,
go into your virtual environment and create a new application:

    workon django2
    cd ~/django_projects
    django-admin startproject locallibrary

    cd ~/django_projects/locallibrary
    python3 manage.py startapp catalog

Edit the file `locallibrary/settings.py` and make the following changes:

    DEBUG = True                        # Do not change to False

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']               # Change

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'django_extensions',             # Add this line
        'catalog.apps.CatalogConfig',    # Add this line
    ]

Edit the file `locallibrary/urls.py` and update the code to look like the following:

    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ]

    # Use include() to add paths from the catalog application
    from django.urls import include
    urlpatterns += [
        path('catalog/', include('catalog.urls')),
    ]

    #Add URL maps to redirect the base URL to our application
    from django.views.generic import RedirectView
    urlpatterns += [
        path('', RedirectView.as_view(url='/catalog/')),
    ]

Note that if you are following the MDN Tutorial for this step, it will suggest
that you add `, permanent=True` to the `path()` statement above.   Do **not** add
the `permanent` parameter or it will mess things up later.

Create the file `catalog/urls.py` and put the following lines in the file:

    from django.urls import path
    from . import views
    urlpatterns = [
    ]

While it is not essential to this assignment, it is a good idea to run the migrations
at this point in time.  In the PYAW shell:

    cd ~/django_projects/locallibrary

    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate

If you get an error when you type the above `python3` commands that cannot
find the `django_extensions` you either have not set up your virtual environment
properly or did not use the `workon django2` command to switch into your
virtual environment in your shell.  When you are in a shell, you need to
be in the `django2` virtual environment or the `manage.py` commands will fail.

On the Web tab
<a href="paw_skeleton/webapp_config.png" target="_blank">Sample image</a>,
we need to switch from the `mytestsite` to the `locallibrary` project so we
need to update the following values:

    Source code: /home/drchuck/django_projects/locallibrary
    Working directory: /home/drchuck/django_projects/locallibrary

Change `drchuck` above to your PythonAnywhere account name.

Edit and change 'mytestsite' to 'locallibrary' (Twice) in the
`WGSI configuration file`.

The virtual environment should already be set up and does not need to change.

    Virtualenv: /home/drchuck/.virtualenvs/django2

Change `drchuck` above to your PythonAnywhere account name.

Then `Reload` your web application and visit its url to make sure you get the expected output.

    http://mdntutorial.pythonanywhere.com/catalog/

When you visit the page,
you *should* get an error, 'Page not found(404)'
(<a href="paw_skeleton/webapp_final.png" target="_blank">Sample Image</a>).
We are stopping this tutorial when the web site is still incomplete so that is normal.

Common Problems and How to Fix Them
-----------------------------------

If you received an "Error not found" page that does not look like the above image,
check to make sure that you have `DEBUG = True` in your `settings.py` file.  If you
set `DEBUG` to `False`, it will make it far more difficult to track down errors in
your code.  Setting it to `True` means that error pages give far more detail.

If you reload your web application and get the "Something went wrong :("
page when you access your web application, check on the "error.log" link
and scroll to the very bottom to see why your application will not start.
