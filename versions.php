<h1>Django for Everybody Versions</h1>
<p>As time passes and Django releases new vesions, this course
needs to be updated.  Very little changes from one version of Django
to the next so if this course is not using the *latest* version of
Django it is usually no problem.  You may see demonstration videos
with older versions of Django that work with a later version of Django.
